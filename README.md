# opnfv-promise -- Resource Management for Virtual Infrastructure

This module presents collection of Virtual Infrastructure Manager
resource entity data models as defined under guidance of [OPNFV
Promise](http://wiki.opnfv.org/promise) project.

`opnfv-promise` is built on top of the
[YangForge](http://github.com/opnfv/yangforge) data modeling
framework. You will need to first install `yangforge` and use the
provided `yfc` command line utility to run this module.

The following are the key features provided by this module:

* Resource Capacity Management
* Resource Reservation
* Resource Allocation

## Installation

Utilizing the latest `YangForge` 0.10.x framework, there is no longer
a need to perform an `install` of this module. You simply need to
*point* `yfc` to retrieve/run assets from this repository.

## Usage
```bash
To run promise plugin manually:
$ cd /usr/local/promise
$ nohup yfc run --express 5050 promise.yaml > /var/log/promise.log &

To run it via INIT script:
/etc/init.d/promise start
```

The `yfc run` command will download/retrieve the primary application
package from the Github repository along with any other dependency
files/assets referenced within the YAML manifest and instantiate the
opnfv-promise module and run REST/JSON interface by default listening
on port 5050.

You can also checkout this GIT repository or simply download the files
into your local system and run the application.

## Primary YANG Data Models

name | description | status
--- | --- | ---
[opnfv-promise](opnfv-promise.yang) | provide resource reservation and capacity management | 95% complete
[nfv-infrastructure](nfv-infrastructure.yang) | common NFV Infrastructure resource models | 80% complete
[nfv-mano](nfv-mano.yang) | common NFV MANO resource models including VIM | 20% complete
[openstack](openstack.yang) | openstack specific VIM extensions | 50% complete

## Promise Information Models

### ResourceReservation

The data model describing the required parameters regarding a resource
reservation. The schema definition expressed in Yang can be found
[here](opnfv-promise.yang).

#### Key Elements

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
start | ys:date-and-time | Timestamp of when the consumption of reserved resources can begin
end   | ys:date-and-time | Timestamp of when the consumption of reserved resource must end
expiry | number | Duration expressed in seconds since `start` when resource not yet allocated shall be released back to the available zone
zone | nfvi:AvailabilityZone | Reference to a zone where the resources will be reserved
capacity | object | Quantity of resources to be reserved per resource types
attributes | list | References to resource attributes needed for reservation
resources | list (nfvi:ResourceElement) | Reference to a collection of existing resource elements required

#### State Elements (read-only)

State Elements are available as part of lookup response about the data model.

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
provider | nfvi:ResourceProvider | Reference to a specific provider when reservation service supports multiple providers
remaining | object | Quantity of resources remaining for consumption based on consumed allocations
allocations | list (nfvi:ResourceAllocation) | Reference to a collection of consumed allocations referencing this reservation

#### Notification Elements

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
reservation-event | Event | Subscribers will be notified if the reservation encounters an error or other events

#### Inherited Elements

##### Extended from [nfvi:ResourceElement](nfv-infrastructure.yang)

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
id | yang:uuid | A GUID identifier for the data model (usually auto-generated, but can also be specified)
name | string | Name of the data model
enabled | boolean | Enable/Disable the data model
protected | boolean | Prevent model from being destroyed when protected
owner | nfvi:AccessIdentity | An owner for the data model
visibility | enumeration | Visibility level of the given data model
tags | list (string) | List of string tags for query/filter
members | list (nfvi:AccessIdentity) | List of additional AccessIdentities that can operate on the data model

### Resource Allocation

The data model describing the required parameters regarding a resource
allocation.  The schema definition expressed in YANG can be found
[here](opnfv-promise.yang).

#### Key Elements

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
reservation | nfvi:ResourceReservation | Reference to an existing reservation identifier
allocate-on-start | boolean | Specify whether the allocation can take effect automatically upon reservation 'start'
resources | list (nfvi:ResourceElement) | Reference to a collection of new resource elements to be allocated

#### State Elements (read-only)

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
priority | number | Read-only state information about the priority classification of the reservation

#### Inherited Elements

##### Extended from [nfvi:ResourceElement](nfv-infrastructure.yang)

Name | Type | Description
---  | ---  | ---
id | yang:uuid | A GUID identifier for the data model (usually auto-generated, but can also be specified)
name | string | Name of the data model
enabled | boolean | Enable/Disable the data model
protected | boolean | Prevent model from being destroyed when protected
owner | nfvi:AccessIdentity | An owner for the data model
visibility | enumeration | Visibility level of the given data model
tags | list (string) | List of string tags for query/filter
members | list (nfvi:AccessIdentity) | List of additional AccessIdentities that can operate on the data model
